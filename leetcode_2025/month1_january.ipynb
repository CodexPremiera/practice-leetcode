    "\n",

    "Now, given the same array of 6 boxes as above, there is another ball at index 3 (`\"001100\"`). From boxes[3], the cummulative sum would be 1 and 2 respectively. Therefore, the answer array is nothing more than the combination of the two answer arrays: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3] + [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 5]`\n",
